I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
