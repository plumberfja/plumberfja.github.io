<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>Sewer line repair is advised when there are fractures or holes in your sewer line. If damage is extreme, replacement of the line is recommended. These are all indications that your unit should be inspected by a plumber. We do not recommend trying to repair this specific home appliance by yourself, because it does provide a safety danger, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and slice waste. Since these chemicals will just damage the device even more, you must also avoid utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
