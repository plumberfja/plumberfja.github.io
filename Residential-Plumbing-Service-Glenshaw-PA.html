Normally speaking, it's best to have a professional plumber examine your backflow preventer at least once a year to ensure it's working appropriately.

<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall hold up against the test pressure defined without revealing any evidence of leakage or other problems. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be carried out utilizing a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as shown by pressure evaluates during inspection shall be deemed to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover contaminants.</p>
