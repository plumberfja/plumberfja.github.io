<p>Installation and replacement costs are typically equivalent, though replacement typically will not need additional charges, such as application costs. New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers might require an unique meter for their services, limiting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure license. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is found, the inspector will issue an offense notice, and a particular time period is allocated to correct the problem.</p>
