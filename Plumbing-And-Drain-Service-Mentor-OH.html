<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
