<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is entirely odor free. The egg odor related to natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home.

For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing.
