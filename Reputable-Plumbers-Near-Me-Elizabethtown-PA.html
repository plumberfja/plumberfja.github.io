<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Elizabethtown PA</h3>
<p>Installed under the kitchen sink, a garbage disposal utilizes sharp blades and a motor to grind (and almost melt) food waste so it can stream down through the drains and into the sewer system.

<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain issues.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>

<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Elizabethtown PA</h3>
