<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
