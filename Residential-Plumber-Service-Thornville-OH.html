Backflow is the undesirable circulation of water or other liquids, mixes, gasses or compounds into the drinking water supply. In the majority of states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any natural gas piping on your residential or commercial property from our gas meter to your home or company. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes.</p>
<p>An air space on a swimming pool fill up pipe should be easily available for inspection and satisfy the rigorous definition of an air gap as defined in plumbing codes and state regulations. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be suggested on pool construction strategies. A full plumbing inspection with one of Costs Howe's expert service technicians will generally last about one hour and will be an extensive introduction of all visual plumbing.

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
