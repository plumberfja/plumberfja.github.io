<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has currently been fouled. Once again, it is a good idea to inspect the manufacturer's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
