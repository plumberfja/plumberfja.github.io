<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
