<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
