<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
