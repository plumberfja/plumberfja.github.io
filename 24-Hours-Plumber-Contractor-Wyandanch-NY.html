Quick heating gas heaters, as a general guideline, will warm water far quicker than an electric hot water heater of the very same basic dimensions and capacity. An electrical water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat two times that amount in the same given time and perhaps quicker.</p>
<p>Any gas line installation or repair needs a license prior to any work can be done.
