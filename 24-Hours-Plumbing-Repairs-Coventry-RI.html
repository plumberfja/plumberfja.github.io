<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any location where it may ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not enable the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not permit the usage of a PVB at all, so check with your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out of under the cap when backflow takes place, so it must be installed in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>

If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
