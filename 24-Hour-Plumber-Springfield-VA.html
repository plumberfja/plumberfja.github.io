<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
