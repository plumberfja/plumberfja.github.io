<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
