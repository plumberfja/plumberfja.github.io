Tankless Water Heaters - If you are tight on area, or if you are interested in minimizing energy expenses when heating water for use throughout your house, then you might want to consider the installation of a tankless hot water heater.

This is a good sign that your pipes may be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be changed.
