<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water in fact needs it. Newer units utilize electronic sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only restore when needed. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
