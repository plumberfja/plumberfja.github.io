If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you ought to require to safeguard yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
