<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>No warm water - The most obvious indicator that your water heater is malfunctioning is an absence of hot water coming from the tap.
