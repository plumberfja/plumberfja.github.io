<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be appropriate if health or ecological factors require restricting sodium. Over time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, recharge and backwash. The regeneration procedure can be arranged immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
