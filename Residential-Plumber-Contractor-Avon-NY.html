<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
