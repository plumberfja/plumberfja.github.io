<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Buffalo NY</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
