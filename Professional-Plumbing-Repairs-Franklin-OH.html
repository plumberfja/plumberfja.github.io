<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Franklin OH</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
