An approved, properly set up and kept backflow assembly basically eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is not enough to make any considerable changes in the savings a gas heater will bring.
