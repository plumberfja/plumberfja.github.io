For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
