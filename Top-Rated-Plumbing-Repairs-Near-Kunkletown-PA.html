<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Copper is a strong product that will not succumb to massive corrosion and complete pipe failure. That's why it's the relied on metal for pipe replacement nowadays. It stands the test of time, aside from the possibility of pitted deterioration. That means that, often, depending on the soil around the pipes and the mineral material in the water, little holes can form in copper pipes, and you'll need to contact plumbers for repairs. A competent plumber can quickly and precisely examine the existing status of your home's plumbing and offer recommendations to ensure your convenience, health, and safety.
