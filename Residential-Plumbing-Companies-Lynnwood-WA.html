Electric water heaters have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity.

<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another mix that can deal with sink clogs.

You can repeat this process if it does not work the first time. We do hot water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases obstructions are inevitable.

<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the issue.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
