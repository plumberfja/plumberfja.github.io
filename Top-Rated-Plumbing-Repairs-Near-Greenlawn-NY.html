<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the technique laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free.
