<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
