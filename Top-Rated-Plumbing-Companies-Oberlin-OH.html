<p>It might a couple of weeks to totally repipe your entire house if you have a big home and don't hire adequate contractors. We highly suggest repiping your house throughout spring or summer season so you don't have to fret about freezing temperature levels during the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment. Normally, if the problem is confined to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is likely the best option. When more than one drain is slow or clogged, it can indicate a larger problem with your plumbing system.

Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
