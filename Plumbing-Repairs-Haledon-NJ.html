It might not be set up in any location where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not enable the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems.

<p>Garbage disposals are created to operate in one of two methods. Either through what's referred to as a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.
