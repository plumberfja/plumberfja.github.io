<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads end up being loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water triggers gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available.
