<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently equivalent, though replacement usually will not need service charges, such as application charges. New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies may require a special meter for their services, restricting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building authorization. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is found, the inspector will issue an infraction notice, and a particular period of time is set aside to remedy the problem.</p>
