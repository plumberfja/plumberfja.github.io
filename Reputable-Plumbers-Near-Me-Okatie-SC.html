Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things differently could have conserved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

The DEP filing charge is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing cost is a little over 1% of the approximated plumbing cost. The size of the device is also a factor in cost. For example, a one-inch device can start at $225, while a three-inch device could cost $2,800. Labor expenses also increase with pipe size.</p>
