If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
