These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
