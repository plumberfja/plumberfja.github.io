<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>An atmospheric pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall endure the test pressure specified without revealing any proof of leak or other problems. Mechanical determines used to determine test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be carried out utilizing a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as suggested by pressure gauges during inspection will be considered to show the presence of a leak.</p>
