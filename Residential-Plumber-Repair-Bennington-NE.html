<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
