<p>More than workforce is required to unclog a drain. Your local plumber should have the best equipment to do the job. We utilize every type of drain cleaning machine out there, varying from small hand snakes to drain devices efficient in clearing big sewer mains. One of the most powerful devices we have is the cable drain cleaning machine, also known as the 'drain snake'. This machine clears drains and sewage systems by turning a versatile cable television made of wire through the pipe. Attachments at the end of the cable aid the process by scraping, boring, cutting pipe clogs like roots and sludge.
