When washing products are used in hard water - tough water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. It's a great idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience obstructions and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Often, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can recognize the issue and find so the drain can be fixed.</p>

Softeners also will remove as much as 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to lengthen the life-span of a water softener.
