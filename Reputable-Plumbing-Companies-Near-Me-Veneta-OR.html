<p>Backflow preventers are vital for developing a safe water system system. A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease buildup, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>A clogged pipe can also enable water to leak into a foundation. This not just weakens the structural integrity of a structure, however it can also let water in through the floorboards, causing them to compromise and stain gradually.
