This has at times led to people believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever truly have been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both detrimental and harmful. Backflow incidents in water systems are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or nothing method to backflow protection.
