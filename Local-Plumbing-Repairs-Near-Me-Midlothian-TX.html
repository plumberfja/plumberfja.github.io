Changing the pipes in your house is essential for preserving a healthy operating water supply and an overall optimum house plumbing system.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
