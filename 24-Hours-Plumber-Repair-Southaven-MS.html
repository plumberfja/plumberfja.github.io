<h3>Blocked Sewer in Southaven MS - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>With unique root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and particles to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe needs to be fixed. The water pressure in the hydro jetting process can be managed to accommodate specific drains like kitchen sinks, floor drains, storm or drain systems, and main sewer lines. We have portable electric systems for inside your house or service and large gas and trailer units for outside concerns. This system not just clears the drain of noticeable obstructions but cleans the drain of waste build-up, restoring its original diameter and making hydro jetting a service that can be depended on for maintenance efforts.</p>

Sometimes, this includes bodily waste and can be cleared up with judicious usage of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a qualified plumber to make it right.</p>
