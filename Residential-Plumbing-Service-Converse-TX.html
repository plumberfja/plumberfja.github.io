<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet efficiency- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Homes that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
