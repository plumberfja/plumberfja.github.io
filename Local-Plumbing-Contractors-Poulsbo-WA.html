Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl).

If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
