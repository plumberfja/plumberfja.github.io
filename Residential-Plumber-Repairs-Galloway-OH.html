<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

In many cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This type of situation may take place if a contractor is dealing with a person's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
