<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from getting in the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
