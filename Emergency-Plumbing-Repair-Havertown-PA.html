If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was developed decades prior to that, possibilities are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>
