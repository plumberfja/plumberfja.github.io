<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
