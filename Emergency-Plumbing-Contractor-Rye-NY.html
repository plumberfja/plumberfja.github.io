<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the approach set out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly real when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
