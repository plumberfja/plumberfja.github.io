It normally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.

<p>The term difficult water" might sound like an oxymoron, however it's merely household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium.

These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
