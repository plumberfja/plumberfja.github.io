Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
