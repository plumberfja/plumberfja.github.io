If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you ought to take to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
