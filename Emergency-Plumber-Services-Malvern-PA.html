<p>Restore your softener with potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is available at the majority of shops that offer softener salt. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area due to the fact that the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank. Clogged blockage and drainage problems may begin as minor issues however can quickly speed up into significant problems. A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
