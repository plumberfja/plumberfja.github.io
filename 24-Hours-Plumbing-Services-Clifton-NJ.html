<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
