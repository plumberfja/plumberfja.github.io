<p>The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to solve the problem. Other times a more extensive option is needed: repiping.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper.

Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
