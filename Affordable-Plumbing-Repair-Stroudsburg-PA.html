<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
