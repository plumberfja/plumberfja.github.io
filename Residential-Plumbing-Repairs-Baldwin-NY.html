<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Baldwin NY Experts</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you need to take to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
