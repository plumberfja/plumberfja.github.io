The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive.
