They use a range of parts and devices that interact for the functionality of a single sink. For instance, a kitchen sink might involve as many as 6 separate systems just to provide the general service we anticipate. Like any machine, a sink has several parts that need repair and maintenance over time. A plumbing license offers three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each.
