Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can repeat this procedure.

Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has currently been fouled. Again, it is suggested to inspect the maker's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
