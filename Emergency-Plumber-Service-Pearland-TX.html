By replacing the bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium ions that trigger water hardness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by addressing its source.

While this may operate in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your house, indicating that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid larger leaks down the road.</p>
