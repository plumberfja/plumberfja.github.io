<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur.
