<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).
