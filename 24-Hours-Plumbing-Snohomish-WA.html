<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
