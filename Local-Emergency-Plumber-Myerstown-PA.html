<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with.
