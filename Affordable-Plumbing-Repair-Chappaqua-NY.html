<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
