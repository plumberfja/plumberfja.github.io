<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
