Check Valve assemblies are the most typical type used on watering systems in Horseshoe Bay.

There's a great opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust.
