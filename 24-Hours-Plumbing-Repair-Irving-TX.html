<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Irving TX?</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers.
