<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Elgin SC</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
