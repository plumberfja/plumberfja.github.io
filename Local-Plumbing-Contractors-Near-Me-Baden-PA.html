If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should take to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
