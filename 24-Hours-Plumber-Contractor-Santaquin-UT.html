The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
