Homes that use gas for heat or for other different appliances have a gas line that connects directly to the heating system, water heater, stove, and other devices that utilize gas.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
