<p>On top of the cost of the actual disposal, a lot of garbage disposal installers charge a hourly rate and can set up a waste disposal unit in a number of hours. Getting rid of an old garbage disposal does take extra time, but all the necessary plumbing and electrical wiring will already remain in place for installing the brand-new one. Continuously needing repairs will begin to get expensive, a new gas line will resolve your problems if you are constantly experiencing gas leaks.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
