A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
