Claims may be rejected since the basic HO-3 property owners' policy particularly leaves out "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance agent and confirm your protection. Once you have read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is correct.</p>

<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
